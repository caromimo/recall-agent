# Agent Recalls

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build an agent and specific tools to safely and effectively explore the publicly available [recalls, advisories and safety alers](https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en). The dataset is also available on [Open Government](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/d38de914-c94c-429b-8ab1-8776c31643e3).

## Tech Stack
This project is using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage packages. It is also leveraging the [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://adk.dev/) to build the agents and its tools.

## Set up
Create a .gitignore file in the parent folder. Add `**/*.env` to the file, to ensure that your gemini key does not get committed.

Once your gemini key is saved in the .env file, you can run the following instead of installing dotenv and importing it at the beginning of the script: 
```shell 
uv run --env-file my_agent/.env
```
